# Setting up your webpage project

## What you’ll be doing in this section

This section will show you how to set up a basic webpage project. You will make an HTML file to detail the basic **structure** of your webpage, and a CSS file to give your webpage **style**. You will then link your HTML and CSS files and verify that your CSS styles work by opening your web page using your web browser.

## Setting up your project directory

Before we start writing the HTML and CSS code, it is important to set up an organized project structure as outlined below.

1. Make a folder on your desktop titled “My first website”.
2. Open VS Code.
3. Do any of the following to open your project:
    - In VS Code, click **File** > **Open** and find your “My first website” folder.
    - In the VS Code Welcome page, select **Open Folder** on the left explorer panel.
      ![Open a Folder](./assets/task1/open-folder.png)
4. Open the folder.
5. Click the **New file** button.
6. Name the new file “index.html” and hit enter.
7. Click the **New file** button again.
8. Name the file “style.css” and hit enter.
9. You should now have a folder with two files in it.

    Here is what the project structure will look like.
    ```
    My first website/
    ├── index.html
    └── style.css
    ```
