| HTML | HyperText Markup Language. The standard language used to create and design web pages. It consists of a set of tags and elements that structure the content and define its layout on a webpage
| HTML element | An HTML element is a fundamental building block of a webpage, representing different types of content or functionality, such as text, images, links, forms, and more. Each element is defined by tags and may contain attributes and nested elements.
| HTML tag | An HTML tag is a code element used to define the structure and content of a webpage. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (`<` and `>`) and usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. Opening tags indicate the beginning of an element, while closing tags denote its end. For example, `<p>` is the opening tag for a paragraph element, and `</p>` is its corresponding closing tag.

Metadata includes elements like `<title>`, `<meta>`, `<link>`, `<style>`, and `<script>`, which convey details such as the document's title, character encoding, stylesheet links, and more. Metadata is crucial for search engines, browsers, and other web services to interpret and display webpages correctly.
