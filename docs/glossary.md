| HTML                              | HyperText Markup Language. The standard language used to create and design web pages. It consists of a set of tags and elements that structure the content and define its layout on a webpage                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| HTML element                      | An HTML element is a fundamental building block of a webpage, representing different types of content or functionality, such as text, images, links, forms, and more. Each element is defined by tags and may contain attributes and nested elements.                                                                                                                                                          |
| HTML tag                          | An HTML tag is a code element used to define the structure and content of a webpage. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (`<` and `>`) and usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. Opening tags indicate the beginning of an element, while closing tags denote its end. For example, `<p>` is the opening tag for a paragraph element, and `</p>` is its corresponding closing tag.          |
| HTML Metadata                     | HTML metadata provides information about the HTML document itself, rather than its content. Metadata includes elements like `<title>`, `<meta>`, `<link>`, `<style>`, and `<script>`, which convey details such as the document's title, character encoding, stylesheet links, and more. Metadata is crucial for search engines, browsers, and other web services to interpret and display webpages correctly. |
| The `<h1>` Tag in HTML            | The `<h1>` tag defines the most important _heading_ in an HTML document. Headings are hierarchical, and the `<h1>` represents the highest level of headings, typically used for the main title or headline of a page. It renders text in a bold and larger font size by default, helping to structure content and improve accessibility and SEO.                                                               |
| The `<p>` Tag in HTML             | The `<p>` tag defines a _paragraph_ of text in an HTML document. It creates a new line before and after the content, making it suitable for long-form text, such as articles, blog posts, and descriptions. By default, it renders text in a normal font size and weight, providing a clear visual separation from other content.                                                                              |
| The `<ul>` and `<li>` Tag in HTML | The `<ul>` tag defines an _unordered list_ in an HTML document. It creates a bulleted list of items, typically used for navigation menus, feature lists, and other collections of related content. Each _list item_ is defined by the `<li>` tag, which renders content as a bullet point by default.                                                                                                          |
| The `<a>` Tag in HTML             | The `<a>` tag, also known as the _anchor_ tag, defines a hyperlink in an HTML document. It creates a clickable link to another webpage, document, or resource. The `href` attribute specifies the URL of the destination, while the text content between the opening and closing tags serves as the visible link text.                                                                                         |
| The `<div>` Tag in HTML           | The `<div>` tag defines a _division_ or section in an HTML document. It groups content together, allowing you to apply styles, structure layouts, and create reusable components. It is often used as a container for other elements, such as text, images, forms, and more.                                                                                                                                   |
| URL                               | Uniform Resource Locator. A string of characters that specifies the address of a resource on the internet. It serves as a reference to locate various resources such as web pages, images, videos, files, etc. A URL typically consists of several components, including the protocol (such as HTTP or HTTPS), domain name, path, and optional query parameters.                                               |
| VS Code                           | a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded version control with Git.                                                                                                                                                                         |
