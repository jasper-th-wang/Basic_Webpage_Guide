### Introduction
This section covers the basics of web development using HTML and CSS, catering to individuals with varying levels of computer skills and no prior knowledge of web development. The guide outlines the tasks you'll undertake, including setting up the project structure, writing HTML and CSS code, and styling the webpage's content. It also introduces conventions used throughout the guide, such as code snippets, examples, notes, and success indicators, to provide additional context and clarification.

### Setting up your webpage project
This section provides a detailed guide on setting up a basic webpage project using Visual Studio Code. It covers creating a folder structure, adding HTML and CSS files, linking them together, and verifying the setup by previewing the webpage in a browser. The guide includes step-by-step instructions, code snippets, explanations of HTML and CSS concepts, and success indicators. By following these instructions, users accomplish setting up a project directory, creating HTML and CSS files, linking them, and applying basic styling to the webpage text.

### Adding your information as HTML
This section guides you through adding content to your webpage using HTML. It includes instructions for reverting changes made in the previous section, then walks you through building your webpage step by step. You'll learn to add headings, paragraphs, unordered lists, and clickable links. The guide also explains HTML tags and provides code snippets for each step. By the end, you'll have structured your webpage's content efficiently with `<div>` tags and created a clickable link to another website.

### Styling your webpage
This section guides you through styling the content of your webpage using CSS selectors and classes. It starts by explaining how to style elements using type selectors, targeting all list items in an unordered list. Then, it demonstrates styling multiple elements using classes, creating a reusable style for headings. The guide includes step-by-step instructions with code snippets for both CSS and HTML files. By the end, you've successfully applied styles to your webpage, including changing the color and decoration of list items and adding background color, padding, and border to a div element. Finally, it highlights your accomplishments and congratulates you on creating a great-looking webpage.

## Methods and Processes Used

### Languages

We used markdown, python and yaml in this project.

### Development tools
#### VS Code

We wrote our comprehensive documentation and README files leveraging VS Code’s Markdown renderer and previewer. 

We also heavily used VS Code's GitLens extension to streamline version control, enabling us to track changes, collaborate effectively with so many concurrent git commits on the same files.

#### MKDocs

We used [Material for MKDocs](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) as the foundation of our project. This tool enabled us to easily add features and integrate style choices into our documentation website. With MKDocs, we could write content in Markdown format and convert it into a static website with essential features like a table of contents, navigation menus, informative admonitions, and a troubleshooting guide.

MKDocs' support for various themes and extensions that are configurable using a `.yaml` file, which allowed us to make the guide that much more easy to use!
