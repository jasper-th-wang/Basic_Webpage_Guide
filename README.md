## Methods and Processes
### VS Code

Visual Studio Code served as a versatile hub for all our development tasks. We crafted comprehensive documentation and README files With its Markdown rendering. Leveraging its integrated terminal, we managed dependencies with ease, especially with MKDocs. VS Code's native Git integration streamlined version control, enabling us to track changes, collaborate effectively, and pinpoint style issues. Real-time collaboration features and extensions like Live Share facilitated swift teamwork, enhancing productivity.

### MKDocs

We used MKDocs, a popular static site generator, as the foundation of our project. This tool enabled us to easily add features and integrate style choices into our documentation website. With MKDocs, we could write content in Markdown format and convert it into a static website with essential features like table of contents, navigation menus, and search functionality. MKDocs' support for various themes and extensions further allowed us to customize and enhance our documentation website to meet our specific requirements.
